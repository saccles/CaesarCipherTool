# Caesar Cipher Tool

A tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher. Written in Python 3.

## Description

This program implements the Caesar substitution cipher and can encrypt and 
decrypt simple messages and strings. Currently, this tool applies a right shift 
of 3 to the standard English alphabet. This program was developed as a 
visual aid for an informative speech on cryptography 
(public speaking course). 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3 and the Python Standard Library
* The Open Source "git" Version Control System
* CMD, PowerShell, Terminal, or some other Command Line Interface (CLI) 
* A Windows, Linux, Unix, or macOS Operating System 

### Installation

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/python-projects7372210/caesar-cipher-tool.git
```

### Program Execution

```
cd caesar-cipher-tool
python3 caesar.py
/\---Caesar Cipher Tool---/\
Encrypt or Decrypt?
('e' = encrypt, 'd' = decrypt, 'q' = quit): e    
Enter the text or message to encrypt: apple

Input: apple
Ciphertext: dssoh
```

## Help

Make sure all program files are stored in one location. The caesar.py program relies on functions stored in caesar_cipher_functions.py and basic_animation_functions.py to run.
